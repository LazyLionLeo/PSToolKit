Features:

- A HTML/CSS templating language (inspired by PugJS) with a very lean syntax.
- A library of common user-interface components, using a hand-drawn style so that nobody mistakes your wireframes for polished layout mockups.
- As-you-type previews and error feedback.
- Automatic scrolling of the preview panel.
